# `06.0` Listening to events

Events work in react pretty much the same way the would do on Vanilla JS, if you want to listen to the user `Click`, all you have to do is add your onClick property (or any other event to the HTML tag) business as usual.

# :speech_balloon: Instructions

The current code has one component that prints on the console "I was clicked!".
- Update the **Alert** component to call it correctly and check then the console.
